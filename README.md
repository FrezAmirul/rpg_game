This was about 3 week project that was develop during Malaysian movement control on december 2020. Project goals is to familiarizing myself with python as it is my first project.

Actually I forgot to publish this repo (late one years lmao). this project challenging as i do not know very much how classes and function work and the source code is not D.R.Y.

My main challenges I ran into was damage that enemy deal as there are randomize and somehow the player keeps dying, so as the solution i fix the probability and add the feture to convert damage to heath.
