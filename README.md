This was a month project build during Malaysian movement control on december 2020. Project goals is to familiarizing myself with python as it is my first project.

Actually forgot to publish this game, (as you can see it is late 1 year). this project challenging as i do not know very much how classes and function work. Thus, the source code is not D.R.Y., too many repeatation.

One of the main challenges I ran into was damage that enemy deal as there are randomize and somehow the player keeps dying, so as the solution i fix the probability and add the feture to convert damage to heath.
